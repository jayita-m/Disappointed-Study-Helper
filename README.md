## About ðŸ“š
* Disappointed Study Helper is a social media blocker for Chrome as an extension. 
* This extension can block any social media websites once turned on, including YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, and Discord. 
* The extension displays a variety of videos of people disappointed/angry/upset that the user has opened up a non-productivity app whilst studying. Feel free to check out the video demo!

* I used Javascript to detect the URL of website being opened. 
* I used HTML and CSS with embedded YouTube videos to make sure that the control bar, and the title of the videos are hidden. 
* I also had to make sure that the video remains unpausable, and is looped until tab is closed. 
* I implemented the Javascript through Manifest.
